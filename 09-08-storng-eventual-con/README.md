1. Strong Consistency for critical features such as user account management and video upload confirmations to ensure data integrity and user confidence.

- Video Management System:
=== Imagine a scenario where a content creator uploads a new video, and then immediately accesses their video dashboard to view the upload. With strong consistency, the system guarantees that the new video appears on their dashboard the moment the upload is confirmed. Similarly, any updates to the video metadata (like title or description) are immediately visible to all users across all devices.


2. Eventual Consistency for less critical, read-heavy features such as displaying user comments or video recommendations to improve system performance and scalability.

- Video Management System:
=== Consider a user who updates the description of their video. In an eventually consistent system, if the user immediately refreshes their video page, they might still see the old description. However, within a few seconds (depending on the system's configuration), the new description will propagate and be visible.
